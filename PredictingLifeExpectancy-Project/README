The goal of this project is to create an innovative AI based model that determines the life expectancy of an individual based on a comprehensive set of medical parameters along with their smoking and drinking habits. Predicting life expectancy can be of a significant importance for healthcare, insurance, and public health policies. This project uses a diverse dataset which has wide range of medical variables including gender, age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels and various medical conditions. Using a combination of data processing, feature engineering and model training, we aim to create a highly accurate predictive model capable of determining an individualâ€™s remaining years of life.
