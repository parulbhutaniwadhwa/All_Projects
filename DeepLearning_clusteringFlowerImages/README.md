Project: Image Clustering Project
This project takes a dataset of different kinds of flowers and using deep learning models identify clusters of similar types.
## Steps to run the project

1. Upload clustering.ipynb file to colab.
2. Upload the dataset in it's raw form i.e. directly upload flower_photos.tgz in colab working directory.
   Note: The code will automatically unzip the tar file and collect all the images from all the inside directories and move it to "all_images" folder.
3. Run all the cells one by one
   Note: image preprocessing step takes around 25 minutes to complete.
